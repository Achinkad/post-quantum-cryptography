# Quantum Computing-Resistant Cryptography

## Abstract of the Work

Quantum computing is undoubtedly a hot topic in the research community, attracting considerable attention due to the latest advancements in technology. With that in mind, this paper aims to clarify the implications of quantum computing in contemporary cryptography and familiarise the reader with fundamental post-quantum algorithms, modern cryptographic principles, and the basics of quantum computing. The reader can explore the following subjects within the scope of this paper: cryptographic schemes (both symmetric and asymmetric), challenges inherent in quantum computing, quantum algorithms, affected public key encryption schemes, impacted symmetric schemes, the repercussions on hash functions, and the domain of post-quantum cryptography. Additionally, relevant open challenges and future work will be presented.
